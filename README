Kindle (beta) code for DTI's Lightning CMS.

1.

You will have to tweak several of my methods in order for this code to work on your system. For example, the headline/text/byline/other extraction methods are probably not going to function on your systemâ€¦ Just replace that code for yours and you should be golden (as long as the method returns the same thing).

If you have any questions, just shoot me an e-mail and I will do my best to help.

2.

If you decide to use this code, then do so on your test server (i.e. do not use your production system to test code).

3.

Use this code at your own risk.
